Developed a distributed platform composed of independent APIs (Users, Admin, Trips, Destinations, Gateway).  
Implemented clean architecture, dependency injection, and secure communication between services.

**API & Automation Framework**  
Built background services for scheduled jobs, email workflows, and data synchronization.  
Integrated task orchestration using Quartz.NET, Hangfire, and API integration for messaging and notifications.

**NotifyMe (Desktop App)**  
WinUI 3 application for wellness reminders with hydration, eye breaks, and visual timers.  
Implements scheduling and persistent local storage for recurring notifications.

**Helderium / Nekoin**  
Developed an ERC20 token in Solidity, adding staking, bridge compatibility, and basic governance.  
Focused on roles, snapshots, and smart contract testing.

**Gateway & Middleware**  
Built an API Gateway using Ocelot for routing, load balancing, and authentication across multiple APIs.  
Configured dynamic environment switching for multi-API orchestration.

**Payments & Reconciliation Engine**  
Developed backend logic for payment reconciliation and transaction association.  
Included logging, state tracking, and multi-database synchronization with SQL Server.

**Workflow Automations & Tools**  
Created automation flows for report generation and notifications using n8n and Graph API.  
Integrated RPA-style triggers for task automation, scheduling, and data ingestion.

### About Me
Curious by nature. Driven by structure.  
Always learning — from microservices to machine learning.  

When I'm not coding, I'm hiking with my dog, capturing the night sky, or building tools that make life smarter.
