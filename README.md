# I'm Helder Pereira

**Software Engineer | System Architect | Team Lead**

I design and build modular systems — from backend APIs and schedulers to automation and data workflows.  
Focused on clean architecture, reliability, and real-world impact.

---

### What I Do
- **Backend Development** — REST APIs, schedulers, and services with `.NET 8`, `Entity Framework`, and `SQL Server`
- **Architecture & Integration** — modular systems, repositories, and API gateways using `Ocelot`
- **Automation & Jobs** — background processes, notifications, and orchestration with `Hangfire` and `Quartz.NET`
- **Frontend Engineering** — `Angular`, `React`, and `WinUI 3` for web and desktop applications
- **Mobile Development** — Android/iOS apps with `Flutter` and `Firebase` (experimental social app prototype)
- **Data & Analytics** — SQL performance tuning, reconciliation engines, and process indicators
- **Security & Auth** — AD integration, `JWT`, `OAuth2`, and internal RBAC systems
- **Blockchain** — `Solidity` smart contracts, staking, governance, and bridge compatibility
- **AI & Workflow Automation** — automation scripts and integrations with `OpenAI`, `Graph API`, and `Google APIs`

### Selected Projects

#### Enterprise Automation & Payments Platform
Architected and developed a large-scale enterprise platform for payment processing, order reconciliation, and automation.  
Focused on microservice architecture, job orchestration, data consistency, and security.  
Stack: `.NET 8`, `Entity Framework`, `SQL Server`, `Hangfire`, `Quartz.NET`, and `API Gateway`.

#### Modular Travel Platform Prototype
Designed a distributed travel management system composed of multiple APIs (Users, Trips, Destinations, Admin, Gateway).  
Implemented clean architecture, cross-service communication, and secure token-based access.  
Stack: `.NET 8`, `PostgreSQL`, `Entity Framework`, `Ocelot`, `JWT`.

#### NotifyMe (Desktop App)
Created a **WinUI 3** application for wellness reminders — hydration, posture, and eye breaks.  
Implements scheduling, notifications, and persistent local storage for recurring reminders.  
Built with `.NET 8`, `MVVM`, and system tray integration.

#### Helderium / Nekoin
Developed an **ERC20 token** in `Solidity` with staking, role-based access control, governance, and bridge compatibility.  
Used `Hardhat`, `OpenZeppelin`, and `Ethers.js` for deployment, automation, and testing.

#### RetailHack
Hackathon project developed overnight with `Node.js` and `Gemini AI`, building autonomous digital agents for retail analytics and content generation.  
Demonstrated full-stack automation and API orchestration.

#### Experimental Social App
Developed a cross-platform social prototype (Android/iOS) for user matching and anonymous interaction, backed by `Firebase`.  
Includes authentication, data sync, and responsive design inspired by swipe-based interfaces.

### About Me
Curious by nature.  
Driven by structure.  
Always learning — from microservices to machine learning.  

When I’m not coding, I’m hiking with my dog, capturing the night sky, or building tools that make life a bit smarter.
